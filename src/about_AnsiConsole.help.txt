SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions for colorizing and positioning on the console using ANSI escape
    sequences.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This modules creates formatted output using ANSI escape sequences. The easiest way
    to use the module is to pipe strings through Set-AnsiConsole, passing the results
    to the host environment. For example:

    "This is red" | Set-AnsiConsole -Foreground BrightRed -Bold

    By default, the functions will automatically apply an ANSI reset to the end of each
    string. This can be disabled by using:

    Set-AnsiAutoReset $false
